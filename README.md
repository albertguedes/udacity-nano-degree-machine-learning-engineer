Repository of my projects made for the Nanodegree course in Engineering of Machine Learning of Udacity.

[boston_housing](boston_housing/) : Project on supervised learning. The main propose is to predict the best sell price to a house on Boston city using regression algorithms.

[customers_segments](customers_segments-pt_BR/) : Project on unsupervised learning. The main propose is classify customers on segments in according to what they buy.

[finding_donnors](finding_donnors/) : Project on supervised learning. The main propose is to predict if a person is a potencial donnor using regression algorithms.

[quadcopter](quadcopter) : Project on unsupervised learning. 
The main propose is to train a virtual quadcopter to learn to fly from a rest point to a another given point using reinforcement learning.

[student_intervention](student_intervention-pt_BR) : Project on supervised learning. The main propose is to predict if a student will or not abandon the school, using regression algorithms to do this.
